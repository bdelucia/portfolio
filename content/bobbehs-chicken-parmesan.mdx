## Introduction

Hi there!

Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

> Why does chicken parmesan have a big ol' slab of mozzarella on it?

> Why do I still feel hungry after I've ate?

> Do I really need THAT much cheese?

If so, then this chicken parmesan recipe is for you!

This recipe is intended to be an easier-to-make and _marginally_ more healthy version of the classic chicken parmesan recipe.

_Note:_ Original credit goes to Adam Raguesa, I largely follow his steps with some variance.
