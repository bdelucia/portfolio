## Introduction

Hi there!

Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

> Why does chicken parmesan have a big ol' slab of mozzarella on it?

> Why do I still feel hungry after I've ate?

> Do I really need THAT much cheese?

If so, then this chicken parmesan recipe is for you!

This recipe is intended to be an easier-to-make and _marginally_ more healthy version of the classic chicken parmesan recipe.

_Note:_ Original credit goes to Adam Raguesa, I largely follow his steps with some variance.

## Ingredients

-   1.0-2.0lb of chicken breast, approx. 3-4 filets
-   ~1/2 bag (about 2 cups) of Private SelectionÂ® Italian Panko Bread Crumbs
-   1 jar tomato sauce
-   3 eggs, beaten
-   1-2 cups of flour
-   Salt, pepper, garlic, (optional) paprika
-   2 cups Pecorino Romano, finely shredded
-   Vegetable oil (or any other frying oil, I've only tried with vegetable oil)

_You may notice that I haven't been too specific with measurements. The amounts of the ingredients depend on things like the thickness of the chicken breast, size of the frying pan and prepartion method (nuggets need more breading per breast than filets), etc. Measure with your heart and cooking will become a lot easier!_
